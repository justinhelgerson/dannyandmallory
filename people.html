						<h2>Danny Wedel and Mallory Warren</h2>
						<img id="this-is-the-girl" src="img/dm-people.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" />						
						
						<p class="text-left"><span class="tall-letter">D</span>anny and <span class="tall-letter">M</span>allory met at UW-Madison in the Wisconsin Singers student performing group in 2007. Mal was a singer/dancer when Danny joined the group as an audio engineer, and they had an almost instant connection.
						Within months of meeting the two were basically attached at the hip, as they both discovered their compatibility and common values: sharing a love of music, being with friends, playing games, and enjoying a generally
						positive outlook on life! After Danny graduated in 2009, he and Mal continued to play music together in local bands: Aisle 9 and later, The Campaign. In 2011, Mal's senior year, they added a special member to their family-to-be:
						a little, 4-month old, rescued pit bull puppy that they named Zaida. After Mal graduated college, the three moved in together on the West-side of Madison.</p>
						
						<p class="text-left"><span class="tall-letter">D</span>anny and <span class="tall-letter">M</span>al have been working in downtown Madison for the past several years, and have enjoyed being able to meet for lunch, happy hours and  farmer's markets together. Danny <u>finally</u> 
						popped the question at one of their favorite summer events, Concerts on the Square, in July 2013. They're thrilled that they will be surrounded by their families and best friends for a celebration of a love that's
						been brewing for the past 7 years!</p>
